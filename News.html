  <h3>Troop 234 Returns from Summer Camp at Woodruff</h3>
  <small>June 28 â€“ July 5, 2025</small>
  <p>Troop 234 has returned from an action-packed week at Woodruff Scout Camp in Blairsville, Georgia. From white water rafting and merit badge progress to fireworks and wildlife encounters, the Scouts made the most of every moment.</p>

  <p>The week was filled with highlights including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>White water rafting on Class through 3 rapids (with only a few splashdowns!)</li>
    <li>Monte and Bryson completing the 1-mile swim challenge</li>
    <li>Hiking treks including 5- and 8-mile routes</li>
    <li>Jackson C. recognized for aiding an injured Scout</li>
    <li>Lawrence completing his board of review for the rank of Star scout</li>
    <li>Evening fireworks show and troop bonding</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Despite several nightly visits from Peanut the skunk and his growing family, Scouts managed to dodge any unwanted sprays by moving through camp with caution and stealth.</p>

  <p>The week wrapped up with packed vehicles, cleaned campsites, and one final group memory under the stars. Scouts returned home tired, proud, and full of stories they won't forget.</p>
