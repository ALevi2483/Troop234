  <h3>New Required Training: Safeguarding Youth</h3>
  <small>May 2025</small>
  <p>Announced at the Scouting America National Annual Meeting in Orlando, the new <strong>Safeguarding Youth Training</strong> is now live and mandatory for all registered adult volunteers. It is also a joining requirement for new adult members.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> ~90 minutes</li>
    <li><strong>Languages:</strong> Available in English and Spanish</li>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> <a href="https://my.scouting.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my.scouting.org</a></li>
    <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> Complete all lessons + score 80% or higher on the final test</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Annual Refresher:</strong> After completing the full course once, a 15-minute refresher and retest is required annually to stay current.</p>
  <p><strong>Transition from Previous YPT:</strong><br>
    - If youâ€™ve already completed Youth Protection Training (YPT), your certification remains valid.<br>
    - If you're currently taking YPT, you have less than one week to finish it. After that, it will be replaced by the new training.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This updated training reinforces a culture of active supervision, situational awareness, and safetyâ€”ensuring weâ€™re all equipped to help keep our Scouts safe.</p>
