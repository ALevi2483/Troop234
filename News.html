    <h2>Please Congratulate Our Newest Wood Badge Participants!</h2>
    <p>
      Please congratulate <strong>Katie Anderson</strong>, <strong>Barry Anderson</strong>, and <strong>Adam Levine</strong> on the successful completion of <strong>Wood Badge Leadership Training – CST15-596-25</strong>, held <strong>May 02–04 & May 31–June 1, 2025</strong>. They are now working on their ticket items—personal goals that will directly benefit Scouting and their local communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year’s course was proudly led by <strong>Troop 234’s very own Kate Sklat</strong> as Course Director, with <strong>Assistant Scoutmaster Charlie Tate</strong> also serving on staff. We are proud to see our troop so strongly represented at this premier adult leadership training!
