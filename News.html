  <h3>🔥 Summer Camp 2025 Recap: Fireworks, Rapids, and Skunks (Oh My!)</h3>
  <small>Woodruff Scout Camp | June 28 – July 5, 2025</small>

  <p>Troop 234 just returned from an epic week at <strong>Woodruff Scout Camp</strong> in the North Georgia mountains — and we brought back more than just dirty laundry.</p>

  <p>The week was packed with adventure, laughter, milestones, and even a surprise visitor (or three) from the local skunk population. Here are just a few highlights:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>🏞️ <strong>White Water Rafting:</strong> Scouts and leaders took on Class 1 through 3 rapids. Some stayed in the raft. Some… didn’t. All came back smiling.</li>
    <li>🏊 <strong>1-Mile Swim:</strong> Monte and Bryson crushed the mile swim — a massive accomplishment only a few at camp attempted!</li>
    <li>🥾 <strong>Hiking:</strong> 5- and 8-mile hikes completed by Scouts and adults alike. The trails were steep, but so were the bragging rights.</li>
    <li>🎖️ <strong>Scout Spirit:</strong> Jackson C. was honored for jumping into action to help an injured Scout on the mountain biking course.</li>
    <li>⭐ <strong>Advancement:</strong> Lawrence completed his Star Scout board of review.</li>
    <li>🎆 <strong>Fourth of July Fireworks:</strong> A camp-wide celebration under the stars, followed by a stealthy return to camp to avoid... skunks.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Yes, skunks. “Peanut,” the unofficial camp mascot, visited our campsite regularly — even making two surprise visits with an adult leader sniffing around *inside* his tent. By Friday, Peanut brought friends. We navigated the last night of camp like wildlife experts... and no one got sprayed.</p>

  <p>Between merit badge classes, ice cream breaks, campfire moments, and stealthy wildlife avoidance, our Scouts showed resilience, teamwork, and what it truly means to be prepared.</p>

  <p>Thanks to all our Scouts, leaders, and parents for making this an unforgettable trip. Now, time to do some laundry.</p>
