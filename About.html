    <h2>Brief History of Troop 234</h2>
    <p>Troop 234 was established over 25 years ago with a focus on the three core principles of Scouting: Duty to God and Country, Duty to Others, and Duty to Self. While the troop is chartered by Covenant United Methodist Church, it welcomes scouts from all faith backgrounds.</p>
    <p>The leadership of Troop 234 is fully committed to supporting non-discrimination policies within the Boy Scouts of America, particularly as they pertain to membership. We believe that all young men, regardless of race, religion, or sexual orientation, should have access to and benefit from the Scouting program.</p>
