    <h2>About Troop 234</h2>
    <p>Troop 234 in Chesapeake, VA has proudly served our community for over 25 years, offering youth opportunities to explore the outdoors, build leadership skills, and grow in character.</p>

    <p>Founded with a commitment to the core principles of Scouting—Duty to God and Country, Duty to Others, and Duty to Self—Troop 234 is chartered by Covenant United Methodist Church, yet welcomes Scouts from all faith backgrounds.</p>

    <p>The leadership of Troop 234 is fully committed to supporting non-discrimination policies within the Boy Scouts of America, particularly as they pertain to membership. We believe that all young men, regardless of race, religion, or sexual orientation, should have access to and benefit from the Scouting program.</p>
